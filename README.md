# Rock Paper Scissors ðŸŽ®

This is my first Python game!  
Itâ€™s a simple Rockâ€“Paperâ€“Scissors game where you play against the computer.

## How it works
- You type in your choice (`rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`).
- The computer randomly picks one of the three options.
- The winner is decided based on the classic rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Paper beats Rock
  - Scissors beats Paper
- If both choices are the same, itâ€™s a draw.
- After each round, you can choose to play again.

## How to run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Clone this repository or download the `.py` file.
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
